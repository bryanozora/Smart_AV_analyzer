# üéß Smart AV Analyzer ‚Äì Smart Audio Transcriber, Diarizer, Summarizer, and Question Answering

**Smart AV Analyzer** is an AI-powered pipeline that transcribes audio, performs speaker diarization, labels speaker turns, generates conversation summaries, and answers questions based on the conversation. It also includes fine-tuning of the `FLAN-T5` language model for the task of dialogue summarization. This project was developed as a final assignment for the **Deep Learning** courses at **Petra Christian University**.

## üìö Academic Context

This project demonstrates a real-world implementation of generative NLP on audio data using state-of-the-art models for automatic speech recognition (ASR), speaker diarization, text summarization, and question answering. It also showcases how large language models can be fine-tuned for better summarization quality on domain-specific dialogues.

## ‚ú® Features

### üîä Audio Transcription Pipeline
- **Automatic Speech Recognition** using OpenAI‚Äôs `whisper-base` model.
- **Speaker Diarization** using `pyannote.audio` to detect speaker boundaries.
- **Speaker Tagging**: Merge speaker information with ASR results.
- **Subtitle Generation**: Create `.srt` subtitle files with timestamps and speaker labels.
- **Text Summarization**: Summarize the full transcript using `google/flan-t5-base`.
- **Question Answering**: Answer Questions using deepset/roberta-base-squad2

### üß† FLAN-T5 Fine-Tuning Pipeline
- **Dialogsum Dataset**: Dialogsum dataset obtained from hugginface https://huggingface.co/datasets/knkarthick/dialogsum.
- **Model Training**: Fine-tune `google/flan-t5-base` on the previously mentioned dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Displaying metrics like accuracy, recall, loss, etc.
